## Pentaho Report Designer (PRD): ##

If you are looking for fancy UIs, PRD is probably not a solution. However, if you
care more about data, the productivity and simplicity, Pentaho report designer
will deserve some of your time. It's especially useful for a backend developer
who can take minimal effort to save tons of loads from preparing ad-hoc reports.

* PRD is perfect for a listing report, knowing the basic `layout` design, editing PRD
  reports can be as easy as editing Word documents.

* Supporting dynamic parameters(from SQL, Tables, open formula etc) which makes the PRD 
  reports user-friendly in terms of data inquries.

* Creating PDF reports with ease. In the old days, I had to maintain Latex documents for 
  business statement in the PDF format.

* Automating complex Excel reports including crosstab and integrating Excel formula 
  directly into the exported spreadsheets.

* Extendable, you can add Javascript (jQuery) for enhanced UI (sortable, dragable etc.)
