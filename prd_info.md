## Pentaho Report Designer (PRD): ##

If you are looking for fancy UIs, PRD is probably not your solution. However, if you
care only about data, the productivity and simplicity, Pentaho report designer
will deserve some of your time. It's especially well designed for the backend developers
who can thus save tons of loads from preparing ad-hoc reports.

* PRD is perfect for a listing report, knowing the basic `layout` design, editing PRD
  reports can be as easy as editing Word documents.

* Support both static (i.e. from Table) and dynamic(SQLs etc) parameters, which makes the PRD 
  reports user-friendly in terms of data

* Creating and automating PDF reports with ease. In the old days, I had to maintain Latex
  documents for business statement in the PDF format

* Creating complex Excel reports including crosstab, and integrating Excel formula directly

* Extendable, you can add Javascript (jquery) for enhanced UI (sortable, dragable etc)
